It includes a short description of what I do, with a focus on my passion for creating intuitive web experiences. You’ll find a quick overview of my interests and open opportunities in the tech industry.

## Project Showcase

In the **Project Showcase** section, you’ll see a collection of the projects I’ve worked on. Each project is displayed with a brief description, a link to the demo, and the associated technology stack used. This section highlights the work I’m proud of and gives a sneak peek into my skills and expertise in the field.

## About Me

This section dives deeper into who I am, what I love doing, and what drives me in both my professional and personal life. Here you’ll find my background, values, and a little bit about my journey in the tech industry. I believe in the power of building meaningful projects that can make a difference in the world.
